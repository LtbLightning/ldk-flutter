/// An error enum representing a failure to persist a channel monitor update.
 enum ChannelMonitorUpdateErr {
  /// Used to indicate a temporary failure (eg connection to a watchtower or remote backup of
  /// our state failed, but is expected to succeed at some point in the future).
  ///
  /// Such a failure will \"freeze\" a channel, preventing us from revoking old states or
  /// submitting new commitment transactions to the counterparty. Once the update(s) that failed
  /// have been successfully applied, a [`MonitorEvent::UpdateCompleted`] event should be returned
  /// via [`Watch::release_pending_monitor_events`] which will then restore the channel to an
  /// operational state.
  ///
  /// Note that a given ChannelManager will *never* re-generate a given ChannelMonitorUpdate. If
  /// you return a TemporaryFailure you must ensure that it is written to disk safely before
  /// writing out the latest ChannelManager state.
  ///
  /// Even when a channel has been \"frozen\" updates to the ChannelMonitor can continue to occur
  /// (eg if an inbound HTLC which we forwarded was claimed upstream resulting in us attempting
  /// to claim it on this channel) and those updates must be applied wherever they can be. At
  /// least one such updated ChannelMonitor must be persisted otherwise PermanentFailure should
  /// be returned to get things on-chain ASAP using only the in-memory copy. Obviously updates to
  /// the channel which would invalidate previous ChannelMonitors are not made when a channel has
  /// been \"frozen\".
  ///
  /// Note that even if updates made after TemporaryFailure succeed you must still provide a
  /// [`MonitorEvent::UpdateCompleted`] to ensure you have the latest monitor and re-enable
  /// normal channel operation. Note that this is normally generated through a call to
  /// [`ChainMonitor::channel_monitor_updated`].
  ///
  /// Note that the update being processed here will not be replayed for you when you return a
  /// [`MonitorEvent::UpdateCompleted`] event via [`Watch::release_pending_monitor_events`], so
  /// you must store the update itself on your own local disk prior to returning a
  /// TemporaryFailure. You may, of course, employ a journaling approach, storing only the
  /// ChannelMonitorUpdate on disk without updating the monitor itself, replaying the journal at
  /// reload-time.
  ///
  /// For deployments where a copy of ChannelMonitors and other local state are backed up in a
  /// remote location (with local copies persisted immediately), it is anticipated that all
  /// updates will return TemporaryFailure until the remote copies could be updated.

  /// Used to indicate no further channel monitor updates will be allowed (eg we've moved on to a
  /// different watchtower and cannot update with all watchtowers that were previously informed
  /// of this channel).
  ///
  /// At reception of this error, ChannelManager will force-close the channel and return at
  /// least a final ChannelMonitorUpdate::ChannelForceClosed which must be delivered to at
  /// least one ChannelMonitor copy. Revocation secret MUST NOT be released and offchain channel
  /// update must be rejected.
  ///
  /// This failure may also signal a failure to update the local persisted copy of one of
  /// the channel monitor instance.
  ///
  /// Note that even when you fail a holder commitment transaction update, you must store the
  /// update to ensure you can claim from it in case of a duplicate copy of this ChannelMonitor
  /// broadcasts it (e.g distributed channel-monitor deployment)
  ///
  /// In case of distributed watchtowers deployment, the new version must be written to disk, as
  /// state may have been stored but rejected due to a block forcing a commitment broadcast. This
  /// storage is used to claim outputs of rejected state confirmed onchain by another watchtower,
  /// lagging behind on block processing.
